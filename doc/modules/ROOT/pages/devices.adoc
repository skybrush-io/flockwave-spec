= Objects, devices and channels

Each UAV in the Flockwave system may consist of an arbitrary number of
_devices_. Devices usually correspond to real, tangible hardware
components of a UAV (such as a CPU, a battery, a LED or a camera), but
they may also represent virtual components implemented purely in
software. Each device may contain additional sub-devices
(sub-sub-devices and so on), and each device (or sub-device) may also
provide a set of _channels_ through which information (e.g., measurement
data) can be retrieved from and sent to the device. Channels have a
_type_ that defines what sort of information one can read from the
channel, or what sort of information one can write to the channel. The
UAV, its devices, sub-devices and channels form a tree-like structure
that is rooted at the UAV itself, and each UAV, device, sub-device and
channel can be uniquely identified by the path leading from the tree
root to the object being considered. These paths are called _device
paths_ (when they terminate at a device) or _channel paths_ (when they
terminate at a channel), or, collectively, they may be referred to as
_device tree paths_. When a path is represented as a string, a forward
slash (`/`) must be used to separate the path components; for example,
`/UAV-17/rotors/rotor1/rpm` can represent the channel providing the
rotations per minute (rpm) for the first rotor of a quadrocopter.

As an example, consider a quadrocopter that consists of four rotors, a
battery, a CPU, a status LED, an on-board RGBW LED strip and a camera.
In this setup, we can identify the following devices, sub-devices and
channels:

* _Rotors_ (device)
** _Rotor 1_ (sub-device)
*** Rotations per minute (numeric channel, read only)
** _Rotor 2_ (sub-device)
*** Rotations per minute (numeric channel, read only)
** _Rotor 3_ (sub-device)
*** Rotations per minute (numeric channel, read only)
** _Rotor 4_ (sub-device)
*** Rotations per minute (numeric channel, read only)
* _Battery_ (device)
** Voltage (numeric channel, read only)
** Charge percentage (numeric channel, read only)
** Estimated remaining time (duration channel, read only)
* _Lighting system_ (device)
** _Status LED_ (sub-device)
*** Is the LED turned on? (Boolean channel, read/write)
** _RGBW LED strip_ (sub-device)
*** Duty cycle of red \(R) channel (numeric channel, read/write)
*** Duty cycle of green (G) channel (numeric channel, read/write)
*** Duty cycle of blue (B) channel (numeric channel, read/write)
*** Duty cycle of white (W) channel (numeric channel, read/write)
* _CPU_ (device)
** _CPU load_ (numeric channel, read only)
** _Reset switch_ (Boolean channel, write only)
* _Camera_ (device)
** _Manufacturer ID_ (string channel, read only)
** _Video stream_ (video channel, read only)

The example above contains almost all of the channel types and
configurations supported by the Flockwave protocol:

*Boolean channels*: Boolean channels provide a single binary value (zero
or one, yes or no, true or false). Typical use-case: turning a certain
component on and off, sending a RESET signal etc.

*Numeric channels*: Numeric channels provide a single floating-point
value. Due to the usage of JSON as the transport protocol, numeric
values provided by the channel must be representable as an IEEE-754
double-precision floating point number. Typical use-case: sending or
retrieving measurement data.

*String channels*: String channels provide a character string encoded in
UTF-8. Typical use-case: sending version strings, manufacturer IDs, or
human-readable debug information.

*Byte array channels*: Byte array channels provide a sequence of raw
bytes. Typical use-case: sending machine-readable debug information, raw
measurements that are too complex for a single numeric channel, or
serialized objects using a non-JSON format.

*Color channels*: Color channels provide an array of three or four
bytes, encoding a color in 8-bit RGB, RGBA or RGBW format. Typical
use-case: color of a LED strip.

*Time channels*: Time channels provide a time instant, expressed as the
number of seconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch in UTC. Typical use-case:
reporting the time of certain important events (e.g., when a UAV was
turned on, when a packet of a certain type was received the last time
and so on).

*Duration channels*: Duration channels provide the length of a time
interval, expressed as the number of seconds elapsed since the beginning
of the time interval. Typical use-case: uptime, flight duration, time
left until a certain event and so on.

*GPS coordinate channels*: GPS coordinate channels provide the location of
some object in the WGS84 reference frame, expressed as an array of numbers that
encode the latitude, longitude, altitude above mean sea level, and altitude
above ground level. Latitude and longitude are expressed as integers with a
quantization of 10^-7^ degrees. Altitudes are expressed in millimeters. When
encoding matters, these numbers should be represented as 32-bit signed integers.

*Cartesian coordinate channels*: Cartesian coordinate channels provide the
location of some object in a not specified fixed flat Earth coordinate frame,
expressed as an array of numbers that encode the X, Y and Z coordinates,
represented as floats.

*Object channels*: Object channels provide complex structured or
unstructured information in the form of JSON-encoded objects.

*Audio and video channels*: Audio and video channels provide real-time
audio or video data. In practice, reading an audio or video channel
typically yields a URL; the client wishing to read the actual audio or
video data must then connect to this URL separately to obtain the audio
or video stream.

Channels may be _read only_, _write only_ or _bidirectional_
(i.e.Â readable and writable).
