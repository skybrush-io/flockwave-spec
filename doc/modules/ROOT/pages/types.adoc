= Data types used in messages

This section describes the complex data types and structures that are
used in Flockwave messages. These data types will be referenced later
from the *Known message types* section.

== Timestamps

Timestamps MUST always be expressed as the number of milliseconds elapsed since
the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Note that this means that timestamps
expressed in local time MUST be converted to UTC before expressing them as milliseconds.

== Dates and times as strings

image:http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601.png[The preferred date and
time format of Flockwave]

Dates, times and durations MUST always be expressed in UTC using an
appropriate http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm[ISO 8601]
format (see also https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339[RFC 3339],
especially section 5.6 if you don’t like paywalls). Unless stated
otherwise, the following formats should be used:

* Dates should be expressed as _YYYY_-_MM_-_DD_ (ISO 8601 extended
format).
* Times should be expressed as __HH__:__mm__:__ss__.__sss__ (ISO 8601 extended
format). The millisecond part may be omitted if not relevant.
* Dates and times should be expressed as the date, followed by a literal
`T`, followed by the time, followed by `Z`, where the `T` is the
standard ISO 8601 separator between dates and times, and `Z` is the ISO
8601 marker for UTC (Zulu time).

== Angles

Angles are always expressed in degrees because radians are for
mathematicians. Depending on the context, angles may either be expressed
in the half-open interval [0, 360), or in the half-open interval [-180,
180) or [-90, 90). For instance, latitudes, longitudes, roll and pitch
are naturally expressed in an interval centered around zero, while
heading and yaw information is typically presented as a non-negative
number. When in doubt, look at the formal JSON schema specification for
the allowed range of an angle.

NOTE: Even though it is common in aviation to indicate 360 degrees
instead of zero degree, we always transmit zero degree instead of 360
degrees in messages because it comes naturally from the way computers
handle modulo arithmetics. The user interface may still opt to present
zero degree as 360 degrees if the user prefers that.

However, when encoding an angle, it is first quantized in 1/10th of degrees
and then encoded as a signed or unsigned integer in order to avoid floating
point related inaccuracies and the accumulation of quantization errors
(see discussion about xref:appendix/floating-point.adoc[floating-point
inacccuracies]). Therefore, the typical range of angles is [0, 3600) or
[-1800, 1800), both of which are well versed to fit in a 16-bit integer.

== Byte arrays

The JSON format does not support the transmission of raw byte arrays
directly since the JSON string type is a sequence of Unicode characters
and not a sequence of raw bytes. When a raw byte array has to be
transmitted in JSON, the typical solution is to send a base64-encoded
representation as a string (see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648[RFC4648]). This representation is
approximately 33% longer than the corresponding raw byte array, but is
still much shorter than the representation of the byte array as a JSON
array of integers.

== Temperatures

Temperatures are always expressed in kelvin because we do not want to take
sides in the Celsius vs Fahrenheit debate. However, when encoding a temperature,
it is first quantized in 1/10th of degrees kelvin and then encoded as an
unsigned integer in order to avoid floating point related inaccuracies
(see discussion about xref:appendix/floating-point.adoc[floating-point
inacccuracies]).

== `Attitude`

An `Attitude` object describes the orientation of a UAV using the
standard roll, pitch and yaw angles. See the section about
<<_angles,angles>> for more information about how the angles are
expressed.

The object is stored as a list with three mandatory items.

Flockwave server manages. It is either a numeric <<_timestamps,timestamp>>,
a <<_dates_and_times_as_strings_as_strings,datetime>> string or one of the
following string values:

`unix`:: The UNIX epoch, i.e. midnight on 1 Jan 1970 UTC.

[#clock-info]
== `ClockInfo`

A `ClockInfo` object describes the current state of a clock or timer
that the Flockwave server manages (e.g., a clock that reports the local
time, the GPS time or a MIDI timecode coming from an external MIDI
device connected to the server).

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]

for the clock. When the epoch is omitted, the clock is assumed to be
ticking since an unspecified instant in the past.

|retrievedAt |yes |<<_timestamps,timestamp>> |the time according
to the internal clock server when the state of the clock was retrieved.
If the internal clock of the server and the client is synchronized, this

A `ColorRGB565` object is essentially a single integer in the range 0 to 65535
such that the most significant 5 bits encode the red component of an RGB color,
the least significant 5 bits encode the blue component, and the remaining 6
bits in the middle encode the green component. This data type is used when some
color information has to be transmitted in a way that does not occupy too much
space in the message, assuming that the exact color is not too important as
there is some quantization error when converting a 24-bit RGB color into
RGB565 representation.

== `CommandExecutionStatus`

the progress of the request (explicitly or implicitly, i.e. by sending
the completed response)

|finished |no |<<_timestamps,timestamp>> |time when the final
response was fully received by the server

    "updated": 1459670842811,
    "progress": 80,
    "status": "Almost ready :)"
}
----

[#command-response]
== `CommandResponse`

A `CommandResponse` object stores the response given by a particular UAV
to a command sent to it using an `OBJ-CMD` request, along with a type
annotation that tells the receiver how the response should be
interpreted.

Currently the protocol defines the following response types:

`plain`:: Plain text response that should be formatted on the receiver
side as is. The receiver side is allowed to use a variable-width font and it
can also perform additional formatting or word wrapping on the text if needed.

`preformatted`:: Preformatted response that should be printed on the receiver
end with a fixed-width font. Newlines and tabulation should also be preserved
on the receiver end if possible.

`markdown`:: Markdown-formatted text response that should be
interpreted by a Markdown processor before it is displayed to the
user.

Additional response types may be defined by the user as needed.

*Example*

[source,json]

    "type": "markdown",
    "data": "# Heading\n\nHello world!"
}
----

== `ConnectionInfo`

A `ConnectionInfo` object describes the purpose and current state of a

connection may be in exactly one of the following five states at any
time:

`disconnected`:: The connection is not alive and no connection attempt
is currently in progress.

reconnection attempt is currently in progress.

`connected`:: The connection is alive.

`disconnecting`:: The connection is not alive any more, but it has not
been properly shut down yet.

`unknown`:: The status of the connection is unknown (typically because
we have received no status information from the connection yet).

The value of a field of type `ConnectionStatus` is always a string with
one of the five values above.

== `DeviceClass`

Enumeration type that describes the possible classes (i.e. types) of
devices in a device tree. Device classes may be used by user interfaces
talking to a Flockwave server to provide some feedback to the user about
the type of a device (e.g., it could show batteries with a different
icon). Currently the following values are registered:

`accelerometer`:: The device is an accelerometer.

`actuator`:: The device is a generic actuator that cannot be

parent by definition. The children of the root node must be nodes of
type `object`.

`object`:: This is a tree node that represents an object that is identified
by its ID in the server. The parent of an `object` node is always a `root`
node. The children of the object nodes must be nodes of type `device`.

== `ErrorList`

This type is simply an array of numbers, where each number represents a
possible error condition. See xref:errors.adoc[Error codes] for a
detailed listing of all the error codes that are currently defined in
the Flockwave protocol.

== `FlightMode`

Enumeration type that describes the typical flight modes of a UAV. The list of
values presented here are not exhaustive; UAVs may use additional flight mode
constants if none of the modes below are suitable to describe the flight mode.
Currently the following values have pre-defined meanings, mostly modelled
after the common flight modes in ArduPilot:

`acro`:: Acro mode; the pilot is controlling the attitude of the UAV directly
and there is no self-leveling.

`alt`:: Altitude hold mode; in the absence of any input, the UAV attempts to
hold its altitude and self-levels the roll and pitch angles.

`auto`:: Automatic mode; the UAV is executing an unspecified autonomous control
algorithm that requires no human intervention.

`circle`:: The UAV is circling around a pre-defined point of interest.

`flow`:: The UAV is attempting to hold its position using an optical flow
sensor.

`follow`:: The UAV is following another device.

`guided`:: The UAV is controlled by an external companion computer.

`land`:: The UAV is attempting an unsupervised landing.

`stab`:: Stabilization mode; roll and pitch axes are self-leveled, but
the altitude is not controlled.

`takeoff`:: The UAV is executing an autonomous takeoff algorithm.

`unknown`:: The UAV is in an unknown control mode.

== `GPSCoordinate`

This type represents a coordinate given by a GPS in the usual
"latitude, longitude, altitude above mean sea level" format using the WGS84
reference system. Additionally, it supports the storage of corresponding
relative altitudes, namely, "altitude above home" and "altitude above ground".

Latitude and longitude should be specified with at least seven digits'
precision if possible. (More than seven digits is usually not necessary
because consumer GPS receivers are not that accurate). To avoid floating point
inaccuracies, latitudes and longitudes are stored in 10^-7^ degrees, and all
altitudes are stored in millimeters as integers.

The object is stored as a list with five items. The third, fourth and fifth
items (AMSL, AHL and AGL, respectively) may be null if they are not known.
Trailing nulls may be omitted.

*Items*

The second item of the list is optional and it may contain the number of GPS
satellites that were used in the calculation.

== `LogMessage`

This type represents a single log message that is sent from the server to the
client, intended for human consumption.

The log message may originate from the server itself, or it may be relayed by
the server from one of the objects (UAVs, docks, weather stations etc) that
the server manages.

== `MagneticVector`

This type represents a magnetic vector; typically the vector of Earth's magnetic
field at a given location. The vector is represented in a North-East-Down
coordinate system (positive axes point North, East and down, respectively), in
nanoteslas.

The object is stored as a list with three items.

== `ObjectType`

Enumeration type that describes the possible object types that the server
knows about. See xref:devices.adoc[Objects, devices and channels] for more
information.

Currently the following values are defined:

that do not have a physical presence.

`dock`:: A docking station.

`other`:: Other object type, not listed here.

`uav`:: An unmanned aerial vehicle.

`weatherStation`:: A weather station.

Values not listed here should also be accepted by the server. If the server
does not know a particular object type, it should simply return an empty list
when the user queries about objects of an unknown type. This allows server
extensions to register custom object types later on.

== `PositionXYZ`

This type represents the position of an airborne object (typically a
UAV) in a local (flat-Earth) right-handed XYZ coordinate system. The origin of
the coordinate system and the orientation of its X axis is typically specific

|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|id |yes |string |The unique identifier of the preflight check item

{
    "id": "compass",
    "label": "Compass",
    "result": "failure",
    "message": "Compass inconsistency detected"
}
----

== `PreflightCheckResult`

Enumeration type that describes the possible results of an item on a preflight
checklist, or the preflight check as a whole. Currently the following values are
defined:

`off`:: The preflight check is disabled.

`pass`:: The preflight check passed.

`warning`:: There were some issues during the preflight checks; this does not
prevent a takeoff but should be investigated later. It may also indicate a
temporary issue that is likely to resolve itself on its own.

`running`:: The preflight check is in progress and there is no conclusive result
yet.

`softFailure`:: The preflight check failed, but it is likely that it will pass
soon without any further operator intervention.

`failure`:: The preflight check failed and it will not pass soon without
operator intervention.

`error`:: There was an error during the preflight check that prevented the check
from reaching a conclusive result. This is usually indicative of a failure in
the code or firmware of the UAV.

[#progress]
== `Progress`

A `Progress` object stores the progress of an asynchronous operation that is
being performed on the server or a remote object (such as a UAV) managed by
the server. It is typically used in `ASYNC-ST` messages.

The progress object consists of a percentage value (`null` if unknown or
indeterminate), a human-readable message (`null` if not specified) and an
optional machine-readable object that can be used for arbitrary purposes if
there is a common understanding of the semantics of this object between the
server and the client. For instance, a long-running RC calibration operation
on a UAV may use this object to report the minimum and maximum values seen for
each RC channel so far during the calibration process, which can be used by
the client to provide visual feedback to the user.

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|percentage |no |integer |Progress of the operation expressed as a percentage,
between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

|status |no |string |Human-readable status message that can be used on the UI
to provide feedback to the user.

|object |no |object |Arbitrary machine-readable object that can be used to
transmit additional information to the client about the progress of the
operation in a structured manner.
|===

*Example*

{
    "percentage": 80,
    "status": "Almost ready, stay tuned..."
}
----

== `Severity`

Enumeration type that describes the severity level of a human-readable message
that the server sends to the client.

Currently the following values are defined:

`debug`:: Debug messages that are of interest to developers only.

`info`:: Informational messages.

`warning`:: Warning messages.

`error`:: Error messages.

`critical`:: Critical errors that require immediate attention.


== `TransportOptions`

Object describing how a particular message should be delivered to a target UAV
if multiple communication channels are available.

This data type is supported by some of the `UAV-...` commands to allow the
sender to specify its preference about how the message should be delivered to
the UAVs. In particular, the transport options let the server know which
communication channel the server should use if the UAVs are reachable over
multiple communication channels (primary and secondary ones), and whether the
server is allowed to use a broadcast message instead of addressing all the
targeted UAVs one by one. The broadcasting option should be used only if the
sender is certain that it is safe to target all UAVs with the particular
`UAV-...` message.

UAVs MAY NOT respect the transport options specified by the sender, but
implementations should try to satisfy the preferences of the caller on a
best-effort basis.

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|channel |no |integer |Index of the communication channel to use if there are
multiple channels over which the UAV can be reached. Zero means the primary
channel, 1 means the first backup channel and so on. Defaults to zero if omitted.

|broadcast |no |boolean |Whether the sender allows the server to use a broadcast
message to reach all UAVs in range. Defaults to false if omitted.

|ignoreIds |no |boolean |Whether to ignore the explicitly defined UAV IDs in the
command in broadcast mode. See below for more details.
|===

*Example*

[source,json]
----
{
    "channel": 1,
    "broadcast": true
}
----

The example above means that the first backup channel should be used and that
broadcasting is allowed.

=== Handling of `broadcast`, `ignoreIds` and UAV ID lists

The interplay between the `broadcast` and the `ignoreIds` field in this object
and a `uavIds` field in the corresponding command deserves a more detailed
explanation. We assume that UAVs are typically reachable via one or more
communication networks, and the server knows which network to use to reach a
particular UAV. The rules are as follows:

* When `broadcast` is missing or set to `false`, the messages sent by the server
will be targeted to the UAVs explicitly listed in the `uavIds` field, and each
such message will be unicast. Sending a command with an empty `uavIds` field
thus generates no messages at all.

* When `broadcast` is set to `true` and `ignoreIds` is `false` or missing, the
server MUST go through the list of UAV IDs and find all the communication
networks that contain at least one of the mentioned UAVs. The server MUST then
send _one_ broadcast message per network. It MUST NOT send broadcast or unicast
messages into communication networks that do not contain any of the UAVs in the
`uavIds` field. Sending a command with an empty `uavIds` field thus generates
no messages either.

* When `broadcast` is set to `true` and `ignoreIds` is also set to `true`, the
server MUST send _one_ broadcast message into all the communication networks
that it uses to manage UAVs, irrespectively of whether it is aware of any
UAVs in that network or not. Sending a command with an empty `uavIds` field will
still generate one broadcast message per network. This can be used for remote
power-on requests when the server does not know in advance how many UAVs there
will be in each network.

== `UAVStatusInfo`

*Example*

[source,json]
----
{
    "id": "17",
    "mode": "pos",
    "position": [519976597, -7406863, 93765],
    "positionXYZ": [0, 0, 0],
    "gps": [3, 17],

The debug information in the above example is then decoded to `0BADCAFE`
using base64.

== `VelocityNED`

This type represents the velocity of an airborne object (typically a
UAV) in the NED coordinate system (also called local tangent plane). The
default unit for the components is mm/s (millimeters per second). For
instance, a UAV moving northeast with ~2.82 m/s (2.82 = sqrt(8)) while
ascending with 1 m/s is expressed by a velocity vector where north=2000,
east=2000 and down=-1000.

The object is stored as a list with three mandatory items.

*Fields*

[cols="1,1,1,7",options="header",]
|===

UAV) in a local (flat-Earth) right-handed XYZ coordinate system. The origin of
the coordinate system and the orientation of its X axis is typically specific
to the UAV. The Z axis points upwards.

The object is stored as a list with three mandatory items.

== `Weather`

This type encapsulates information about the weather at a given time and
geographical coordinate. Objects of this type are typically provided by
weather stations or external weather APIs.

The structure of this object is heavily influenced by the OpenWeatherMap
one-call API response. Almost all of the fields are optional to account
for use-cases when a weather station cannot provide one or more of the
response fields; only the position and the timestamp are mandatory.
