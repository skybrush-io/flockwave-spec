= Error codes

Error codes are typically small non-negative integers, divided into
seven groups as follows:

No error (code 0)::
Code zero is reserved for the "no error" condition. Since
xref:types.adoc#_uavstatusinfo[UAVStatusInfo] structures contain a __list__ of
error codes, this error code is typically not used because it is enough to
send an empty list to declare that there is no error.

Informational messages (codes 1-63)::
These messages contain information that the UAV operators should be aware of,
but that do not represent danger to the normal operation of the UAV. For
instance, a UAV may use this code range to indicate that coordinate logging has
stopped due to low disk space.

Warnings (codes 64-127)::
These codes should be used for conditions that do not present _immediate_ danger
to the normal operation of the UAV but that will become a problem in the near
future if left unhandled. For instance, low battery warnings belong to this
category.

Error conditions (codes 128-191)::
These codes should be used in cases when the UAV has detected a problem that
prevents it from continuing normal operation, but the situation is not severe
enough to warrant an immediate landing attempt. UAVs typically switch to an
automatic "return to home" or "loitering" mode when they detect such a
condition.

Fatal errors (codes 192-255)::
These codes should be used when the UAV has detected a severe malfunction that
triggers an immediate landing attempt (if such an attempt is feasible) or an
uncontrolled shutdown in the worst case.

UAV-specific error codes (codes 256-32767)::
These codes will be used in the future for custom, UAV-specific error conditions
should such error codes become necessary. The range will be divided into blocks
of 256 error codes, each of which can be allocated for a specific UAV type
that future versions of this protocol will support.

User-defined error codes (codes 32768 and above)::
Custom, unofficial extensions of the Flockwave protocol are free to use this
range for any purpose.

Note that for error codes less than 256, `(errorCode & 0xFF) >> 6` will
simply return the severity class of the error code (class 0:
informational messages, class 1: warnings, class 2: errors, class 3:
fatal errors). Ideally, this property should be kept also for codes
above 256 whenever possible to make it easier for Flockwave GUI clients
to derive the severity of an error message even if the actual semantics
of the error message is not known to the GUI client.

The following tables list all the commonly used error codes in
xref:types.adoc#_errorlist[ErrorList] members typically found in
xref:types.adoc#_uavstatusinfo[UAVStatusInfo] structures. The tables also
list a proposed abbreviation for some of the error codes; this can be used
on user interfaces where space is at a premium.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|Code |Abbr  |Description
|1  |GROUND  |Drone is on the ground. If no other error codes are set, this code
alone means that the drone is ready to take off.
|2  |NO LOG  |Logging deactivated. This message is shown when logging-capable UAVs
are not able to write entries to their logs for some reason.
|3  |PREARM  |Prearm check in progress. This message is shown when the UAV is performing
prearm checks and is not ready for takeoff yet.
|4  |INIT    |Autopilot initializing. This message is shown when the autopilot of the
UAV has not finished initializing and the UAV is not ready for takeoff yet.
|5  |TAKEOFF |Drone is taking off.
|6  |LANDING |Drone is landing.
|7  |LANDED  |Drone has landed successfully.
|8  |MOTORS  |Motors are running while the drone is on the ground.
|9  |SLEEP   |Drone is in a low-power "sleep" state. Flight controller is most
likely powered down, but it can be resumed remotely.
|10 |PAUSED  |The high-level flight control of the drone is suspended temporarily.
|11 |SLOW    |Slow flight mode is activated in the high-level flight control of the
drone temporarily.
|63 |RTH     |Drone is returning to its home position.

== Warnings (codes 64-127)

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|Code |Abbr |Description
|64 |STORAGE |Low disk space. This message is shown by UAVs having an internal
storage (e.g., an SD card) in cases when they are running out of free
space on the storage device.

|65 |RC LOST |RC signal lost. Use this error code only if the UAV can deal with
this situation (e.g., when it is running an algorithm that does not
require external control in normal conditions); otherwise use code 131.

|66 |LOWBAT |Battery low. Use this error code only if the UAV is still safe to
continue its current mission with the current battery charge; otherwise
use code 134 or 199.

|67 |TIMESYNC |Timesync error. Use this error code if the UAV tries to synchronize
its own clock with an external time source (such as the GPS system) and
it fails to do so.

|68 |TKOFFPOS |The UAV is going to fly a mission that specifies the takeoff position
of the UAV, and it is not placed at the right takeoff position.

|69 |MISSION |There is an error with the current mission configuration of the UAV;
for instance, the mission would take the UAV outside the current geofence zone.

|70 |NO RADIO |The UAV is supposed to use a radio channel for communication, but
it indicates that the channel is currently not available.

|71 |FENCE |Geofence violation (out of flying zone). Use this error code only if
the UAV is likely to stand idle on the ground; otherwise use code 201.

|72 |WIND |Wind speed is high. Use this error code if wind levels are high enough
to lower the stability and decrease the flight envelope of your UAV but it is still
able to navigate in all directions safely; at more severe wind levels use code 139.

|73  |DISARM   |Drone not armed yet. This warning is shown when the UAV is in a
state that motor thrust is prevented by a hardware or software switch.

|74  |REBOOT   |Drone requires a reboot. This warning is shown after the UAV
has performed an action (typically some low level calibration or parameter
change) that requires a reboot and re-initialization.

|75  |DRIFT   |Unexpected drift from desired position. This warning appears when
the drone deviates from its desired trajectory more than what is allowed under
normal operation conditions.

|127 |WARNING |Other, unspecified warning that does not present immediate danger
to the normal operation of the UAV; for more severe unspecified error states
use code 191.

== Errors (codes 128-191)

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|Code |Abbr |Description
|128 |COMM T/O |Autopilot communication timeout. High-level control algorithms
failed to communicate with a lower-level autopilot component. The
autopilot will probably attempt RTH or switch to loiter mode.

|129 |ACK T/O |Autopilot acknowledgment timeout. A lower-level autopilot component
did not acknowledge a command sent to it by a higher-level control
algorithm.

|130 |PROTO |Autopilot communication protocol error. High-level control
algorithms failed to parse a message sent by the lower-level autopilot
component or vice versa. The autopilot will probably attempt RTH or
switch to loitering mode.

|131 |PREARM |Prearm check failure. One of the pre-flight checks has failed.

|132 |RC LOST |RC signal lost. Use this error code only if the UAV can not deal
with this situation and will RTH or land; otherwise use code 65.

|133 |NO GPS |GPS error or GPS signal lost. Use this error code only if loitering
is probably still possible with the remaining sensors; otherwise use
code 197.

|134 |LOWBAT |Battery low. Use this error code only if the UAV is not safe to
continue its current mission with the current battery charge but can
safely attempt RTH or loitering; otherwise use code 66 or 199.

|135 |TARGET |Target not found. The UAV does not find the target waypoint or
beacon that it should attempt to follow.

|136 |TOO FAR |Target is too far. The target of the UAV is outside the allowed
safety distance.

|137 |CONFIG |Configuration error. The confirmation of the UAV is incorrect. Depending
on the type of the UAV, this can typically be resolved by adjusting some
configuration parameters or configuration files on the UAV.

|138 |RC CALIB |RC not calibrated. The remote controller of the drone is most
likely not calibrated. Use this error code only for drones that require an RC
calibration; toy drones or drones that do not need RC calibration typically do
not need to use this error code.

|139 |WIND |Wind speed is too high. Use this error code if the wind levels are
too high to safely navigate in all directions and thus an immediate emergency
action (e.g. "return to home" or "altitude decrease") is necessary to prevent
reversing in headwind.

|140 |PAYLOAD |Payload error. Use this error code for general payload-related
error states.

|141 |PROXIMITY |Proximity sensor error.

|188 |SIMERR |Simulated error. Use this error code to trigger a simulated RTH or
loitering in the absence of any other error, for testing purposes.

|189 |CONTROL |Error in control algorithm. Use this error when the higher-level
control algorithm that drives the autopilot of the UAV failed to produce
sensible input for the autopilot.

|190 |SENSOR |Other, unspecified sensor failure that does not prevent RTH or
loitering.

|191 |ERROR |Other, unspecified error that does not prevent RTH or loitering. For fatal unspecified errors use error code 255.

|===

== Critical errors (codes 192-255)

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|Code |Abbr |Description
|192 |COMPAT |Incompatible hardware or software. Some hardware or software
components are not compatible with each other; e.g., using a
PixHawk-based autopilot with an incompatible FlockCtrl software.

|193 |MAG |Magnetic sensor error.

|194 |GYRO |Gyroscope error.

|195 |ACC |Accelerometer error.

|196 |BARO |Pressure sensor or altimeter error.

|197 |GPS |GPS error or GPS signal lost. Use this error code only if loitering
will not be attempted by the UAV with the remaining sensors; otherwise
use code 133.

|198 |MOTOR |Motor malfunction.

|199 |LOWBAT |Battery critical. Use this error code only if the UAV is not safe
to continue its current mission or to attempt RTH or loitering;
otherwise use code 66 or 134.

|200 |HOME |No GPS home position.

|201 |FENCE |Geofence violation (out of flying zone). When leaving the
designated flying zone, it is generally assumed that the UAV does not
(and can not) know how to navigate back to the flying zone so it will
attempt to land where it currently is, or switch to RTH mode, assuming that
the path from the current location to home is (mostly) in the permitted
flying zone. Use this error code only if the UAV is likely to be airborne;
otherwise use code 71.

|202 |CLK |Internal clock error. This code should be used if one of the
internal clocks of the UAV is not set properly. Use code 203 for
external clocks.

|203 |EXTCLK |External clock error. This code should be used if one of the
external clocks required for the operation of the UAV is not set
properly. Use code 202 for internal clocks.

|204 |NO HW |Required hardware component missing. The UAV can not communicate
with one of the hardware components that it needs to use during its
mission.

|205 |INITFAIL |Autopilot initialization failed. The UAV cannot set up its own
autopilot in a way that is suitable for its mission.

|206 |COMMFAIL |Autopilot communication failed. The UAV tried to communicate with
its autopilot but the communication failed in a non-recoverable way.

|207 |CRASH |Drone crashed.

|253 |SIMCRIT |Simulated critical error. se this error code to trigger an
emergency landing in the absence of any other critical error, for
testing purposes.

|254 |SENSOR |Other, unspecified sensor failure that triggers an immediate
landing attempt.

|255 |FATAL |Other, unspecified fatal error that triggers an immediate landing
attempt.
