= `RTK` — Real Time Kinematics related messages

Flockwave servers may manage Real Time Kinematics (RTK) corrections;
these corrections may be received from an RTK-capable GNSS based
station, can be displayed on the user interface in a Flockwave client
or may be broadcast to UAVs in the range of the Flockwave server for
enahncing GNSS positioning accuracy.

RTK based stations need to be configured before use with either a
fixed known position or with initiating an auto survey to measure its
own location accurately. Base stations will start to send correction
signals to UAVs only when they have acquired a known position.

RTK base stations are identified by unique string identifiers (just
like objects or connections). These may include RTK presets from a
remote NTRIP source or local base stations connected through e.g. a
serial port.


== `RTK-INF` — Retrieve status of an RTK preset

A client sends this request to the server to retrieve the status of one
or more RTK presets (base stations) managed by the server.

== `RTK-SOURCE` — Query or select an RTK source managed by the server

A client sends this request to the server to either query the current RTK
preset or to select an RTK preset that will be used as the active RTK base
station that sends RTK corrections to the UAVs through the server.

The response will be another `RTK-SOURCE` packet when querying the current
RTK source, or an `ACK-ACK` when setting the RTK source.
