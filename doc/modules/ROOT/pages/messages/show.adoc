= `SHOW` â€” Management and execution of drone shows

The messages in this section are used to get or set the configuration of
both the drone show and the LED lights on the drones.

== `SHOW-CFG` - Retrieve the current configuration of the drone show

A client sends this request to the server to obtain information about 
the configuration of the drone show.

The server response contains an object of type xref:types.adoc#_droneshowconfiguration[`DroneShowConfiguration`],
which for example can contain information about whether the show is authorized to start, the timestamp when the
drone show should start, the identifier of the clock that the start time refers to and more.

== `SHOW-LIGHTS` - Retrieve the current configuration of the behaviour of the LED lights on the show drones

A client sends this request to the server to obtain information about 
the configuration of the behaviour of the LED lights on drones participating in the show.

The server response contains an object of type xref:types.adoc#_dronelightsconfiguration[`DroneLightsConfiguration`],
which can contain information about the type and the color of the light effect used. The type of the light effect
can either be `off` or `solid`. The former means that the GCS is not controlling the LED lights on the drones, while
the latter means that the GCS is asking the show drones to use a solid LED light.
