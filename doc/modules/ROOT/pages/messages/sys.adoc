= `SYS` — System information

== `SYS-CLOSE` - Notifies the client that the connection is about to be closed

A server sends a notification of this type to a client when the client will be
forcibly disconnected from the server. Clients may then display the reason
attached to the message to the user if it is practical to do so.

Typical reasons for a forced disconnection may be:

* the server is shutting down
* the server is limiting the number of concurrent connections
* the server is enforcing limits on the maximum duration of a connection

Note that servers are not _required_ to send this message upon a disconnection;
the message is sent only as a courtesy to the user at the other end of the
connection.

== `SYS-PING` — Check whether a connection is alive

Either party in the connection may send a `SYS-PING` message to the
other party to test whether the connection is still alive. Parties
receiving a `SYS-PING` message are expected to respond with an
xref:messages/ack.adoc#_ack_ack_positive_acknowledgment[`ACK-ACK`] message as soon
as it is practical to do so.

Note that each party may decide whether it wants to send `SYS-PING`
messages over the wire periodically. Typically, the message is used to
implement "heartbeating" to detect broken connections. If the
transport protocol used to convey Flockwave messages implements
heartbeating on its own, there is no additional benefit to firing
`SYS-PING` messages. However, when Flockwave messages are transmitted
over a plain TCP connection, `SYS-PING` messages may be used by either
side to detect when the connection was dropped.

Responses should not be sent with this type; use
xref:messages/ack.adoc#_ack_ack_positive_acknowledgment[`ACK-ACK`] instead.

== `SYS-PORTS` - Return the mapping of registered services on the server to the corresponding ports

A client sends a request of this type to the server in order to retrieve the
mapping from services and communication channels offered by the server to the
corresponding TCP or UDP port numbers. There is no formal specification for the
service names yes, but the reference implementation of the server uses service
IDs as follows: `tcp` for the TCP-based communication channel, `udp` for the
UDP-based communication channel, `ssdp` for the Simple Service Discovery
Protocol (used by clients to discover the existence of the server) and `http` for
a HTTP-based user interface and a WebSockets channel.

== `SYS-TIME` - Retrieve or adjust the server clock

A client sends a request of this type to the server to obtain an accurate
representation of the current UNIX timestamp on the server, or to adjust the
server clock by a given number of milliseconds if the server allows it.

The retrieval form of the message is typically used to measure round-trip time
and estimate clock skew between the client and the server, so care should be
taken on the server side to ensure the accuracy of the returned timestamp to the
extent permitted by the transport protocol.

The adjustment form of the message uses a relative adjustment deliberately. The
idea is that one should first estimate the round-trip time and the necessary
adjustment between client and server to bring their clocks in sync (using the
retrieval form of the `SYS-TIME` message), and then send the required adjustment
to the server only, avoiding the need to compensate for the round-trip time
once again.

|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|`adjustment` |no |number |The number of milliseconds that the clock of the server should be forwarded by. Use zero to detect whether the server supports clock adjustment or not.

== `SYS-VER` — Version number of the server

A `SYS-VER` request retrieves the version number of the server.

*Request fields*

This request has no fields.

*Response fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|`name` |no |string |The name of the server. May be used to distinguish
between multiple servers running concurrently so the operators know that
they are connecting to the right server from the client.

|`revision` |no |string |The revision number of the server, if known.
This field is optional and can be used to convey more detailed version
information than what the `version` field allows; for instance, one
could provide the Git hash of the last commit in the server’s
repository.

|`software` |yes |string |The name of the server implementation.

|`version` |yes |string |The version number of the server, in
major.minor.patch format. The patch level is optional and may be
omitted.
