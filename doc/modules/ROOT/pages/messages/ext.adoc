= `EXT` — Management of extension modules

Flockwave server implementations may be built in a modular manner such that
certain parts of its functionality are provided by extension modules. Messages
in this group provide facilities for loading, unloading and reconfiguring
extensions.

Note that Flockwave server implementations MUST provide handlers for these
messages even if the server itself does not provide extensions. In such
cases, requests for the list of extensions MUST return an empty list, and
all other messages referring to specific extensions can simply return an
error code.
