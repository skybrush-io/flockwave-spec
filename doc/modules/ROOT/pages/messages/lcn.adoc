== Custom types

This section lists the custom types used solely by `LCN-...` messages.

[#license]
=== `License`

A `License` object represents a license installed on the server. Licenses
MUST have a vendor-defined ID that can be used to identify the license
unambiguously; vendors MUST make sure not to re-use old license IDs when
generating new licenses. The license MUST also have a corresponding licensee
name, an optional version number, an optional expiry date, and an optional list of additional restrictions
and extra features.

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|id |yes |string |the unique identifier of the license. An empty string if the
server operates without a license.

|version |no |integer |the version of the license. If missing, version 1 is assumed.

|licensee |yes |string |the name of the licensee

|expiryDate |no |string |the expiry date of the license, in year-month-day format, if any

|restrictions |no |array of <<license-restriction,LicenseRestriction>>s |the list of restrictions
associated to the license, if any. Defaults to an empty array.

|features |no |array of <<license-feature,LicenseFeature>>s |the list of extra features associated
to the license, if any. Defaults to an empty array.

        }
    ]
}

[#license-feature]
== LicenseFeature

A `LicenseFeature` object represents an additional feature of the server that
is normally not available but that the license enables explicitly when loaded.

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|type |yes |string |the type of the feature

|label |no |string |a human-readable description of the type of the feature

|secondaryLabel |no |string |a human-readable description that provides additional
context about the feature; e.g., the values of the most important parameters

|parameters |no |object |a key-value mapping that provides additional parameters
to the feature, to be interpreted according to the type of the feature
|===

*Example*

[source,json]
----
{
    "type": "some-extra-feature",
    "label": "spam spam spam",
    "secondaryLabel": "Lovely spam! Wonderful spam!"
}

[#license-restriction]
== LicenseRestriction

A `LicenseRestriction` object represents a kind of restriction on the normal
usage conditions of a license. A few possible examples of such restrictions are
as follows:

* restricting the usage of the license only to machines with certain MAC addresses

* restricting the usage of the license only to machines having a certain hardware ID

* limiting the number of UAVs that can be handled by the server simultaneously

Each restriction object has a mandatory type, optional human-readable primary
and secondary labels, and a parameter object that consist of key-value pairs.
The interpretation of parameters depends on the type of the restriction.
The following restrictions are defined by this specification:

`mac`:: restricts the usage of the license to machines with certain MAC
addresses. The parameters object MUST contain a key named `addresses` whose
value is a list of MAC addresses. MAC addresses must be specified in colon
notation, with uppercase hexadecimal characters, although clients MAY interpret
MAC addresses in other formats (e.g., dashed notation or lowercase hexadecimal
characters).

`drones`:: puts an upper limit on the number of drones that the server can
handle simultaneously. The parameters object MUST contain a key named `maxCount`
that contains the maximum number of drones that the server can handle.

The primary labels SHOULD typically provide a human-readable description of the
type of the license, without mentioning the exact parameter values. A secondary
label MAY be added to provide additional context, including the values of the
parameters, when relevant.

|label |no |string |a human-readable description of the type of the restriction

|secondaryLabel |no |string |a human-readable description that provides additional
context about the restrictions; e.g., the values of the most important parameters

|parameters |no |object |a key-value mapping that provides additional parameters
to the restriction, to be interpreted according to the type of the restriction
